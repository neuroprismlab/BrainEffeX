Participants were instructed to relax while maintaining passive visual fixation on a crosshair presented centrally on screen (Casey et al. 2018).,"Functional images were motion-corrected using SPM5. The data were then iteratively smoothed to an equivalent smoothness of a 2.5 mm Gaussian kernel in order to ensure uniform smoothness across the dataset. White matter and CSF were defined on a MNI-space template brain and eroded in order to minimize inclusion of grey matter in the mask. The template was then warped to subject space using a series of transformations described in the next section. This ensured that mainly grey matter voxels were used in subsequent analyses. The following noise covariates were regressed from the data: linear, quadratic, and cubic drift, a 24-parameter model of motion, mean cerebrospinal fluid signal, mean white matter signal, and mean global signal. Finally, data were temporally smoothed with a zero mean unit variance Gaussian filter (cutoff freq=0.19 Hz). Anatomical data were first skull-stripped using FSL. Functional data for each subject, scanner, and session were linearly registered to the corresponding FLASH images. FLASH images were then linearly registered to MPRAGE images. Next, an average MPRAGE image for each subject was created by linearly registering and averaging all 4 anatomical images (from 2 scanner × 2 sessions) for each subject. These average MPRAGE images were used for an iterative nonlinear registration to MNI space. The use of the average anatomical images and a single nonlinear registration for each subject ensures that any potential anatomical distortions due to the different scanners does not introduce a systematic bias into the registration. The average MPRAGE images were nonlinearly registered to an evolving group average template in MNI space as described previously. All transformation pairs were calculated independently and then combined into a single transform that warps single participant results into common space. From this, all subjects’ images can be transformed into common space using a single transformation, which reduces interpolation error.",20 mins (Casey et al. 2018).,age_months,Age in months,

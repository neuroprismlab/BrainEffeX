# Brain EffeX
This repository contains the code for the [BrainEffeX web app](https://neuroprismlab.shinyapps.io/BrainEffeX/) for exploring fMRI effect sizes. 

The preprint for this web app is available [here] (https://osf.io/preprints/osf/kryn4_v1).

Effect map data is hosted at https://osf.io/cwnjd/files/osfstorage (file too large for Github).

The code for the analysis that produced the data fed into the app can be found at https://github.com/neuroprismlab/calculate_effeX. 

An R package containing useful functions used in this app (and in related publications) can be found at https://github.com/neuroprismlab/BrainEffeX_utils.

If you have data to contribute to the app, please see the README.md file in the for_contributors/ directory.
